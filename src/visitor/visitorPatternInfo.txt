Behavioural Design Pattern - Visitor Pattern


separate algorithms / behaviours from the objects on which they operate
e.g., client objects
adding messaging requires the clients "accept" a visitor in the objects themselves


visitor class changes execution of an element class,
the element object has to accept a visitor object,
the visitor object handles operation on the element object
