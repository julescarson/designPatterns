Behavioural Pattern

* we are executing a strategy based on a context
.. context.executeStrategy
.. context takes in a strategy object, and based on that strategy, our operation changes
*good example of polymorphism

Behaviour Pattern:
- With the strategy pattern a class behaviour or algorithm can be changed at runtime
- Create objects to represent strategies
- Add a context object whose behaviour varies per its strategy object
- Strategy object changes the executing algorithm of the context object

In this package:
- Strategy Interface - definition of an operation
- Concrete Strategy class - implementation of the interface
- Context - class which uses a Strategy
- in Main: Context and strategy objects demonstrating change in context behaviour
